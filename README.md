# Simply Budget
# Motivation
> "We must consult our means rather than our wishes." ― George Washington
We wanted to create a budgeting app that stores user data online and can be accessed anywhere. It would also be user friendly and easy to read. Users can create an account, add transactions and budgets and keep track of their spending month to month. This app was created as a part of the DigitalCrafts 26 week Flex full stack program. The capstone project of the course which required us to use a full stack of front end, back end, and database technologies.
# Tech/framework used
Front end - React with bootstrap, router
Back End - Node.js, PostgreSQL, express, netlify
# Features
Create an account and keep your budgets safe wherever you go
Add budgets and transactions to visualize your spending

# Installation
## Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
### `npm run eject`
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**
If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.
You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
